Solution to the problem statement:

Create an S3 storage where the backed up files will be stored

Create an EC2 instance

ssh into that EC2 instance using
ssh -i ssh-key.pem ec2-user@<EC2 public ip>

# Update package list
sudo yum update -y

# Install Python 3 and pip
sudo yum install python3.11 -y
sudo yum install pip -y

# Install required libraries
pip3 install boto3 cryptography schedule

Create IAM role for EC2 to access the S3 storage
Create IAM Role for EC2
Go to IAM in the AWS Management Console.
Create a new Role with the following policies:
AmazonS3FullAccess (for interacting with S3)
CloudWatchLogsFullAccess (optional, for logging backup status)

Attach this role to your EC2 instance:
In the EC2 Dashboard, go to your instance and click Actions > Security > Modify IAM Role.
Select the IAM role you just created and attach it.

Write Python Backup Script

create files to be backed up in the ec2 instance

Test if everything is working as fine
